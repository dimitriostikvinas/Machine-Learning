        "As the number of estimators increases, the training time scales linearly because each estimator needs to be trained independently, as the way the bagging classifier works, meaning that it involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset and training a separate classifier on each subset.\n",
        "\n",
        " One way to solve this problem is to parallelize the training process, an approach which doesn't disturb the classifier's functionality because, as we said earlier, each estimator is trained independently. \n",
        " \n",
        " No, we cannot use the same solution to boosting classifiers, due to their approach of typically having a sequential training process, where each subsequent estimator focuses on the samples that were misclassified by the previous ones. "
